		<h1>CAREER JOURNEY</h1>
		<p> <!-- Tata Motor Experience -->
			<h3>From 1998 to 2000 ..My Experience with TataMotors...</h3>
			<p>
				I started my career in 1998 as a software engineer with Tata Motors India. Tata Motors is an automobile company in India and it manufactures passenger cars and trucks. I started as a trainee engineer in the Services and Spare Parts IT division working on Oracle, Unix, Pro*C, D2K to prepare the reports required for the unit. While with Tata, I worked on the Y2K migration project and helped in migrating applications from Oracle to SAP modules.

		<p> <!-- My Experience with Infosys -->
			<h3>From 2000 to 2006..My Experience with Infosys Technologies...</h3>
			<p>
				In mid 2000, I joined Infosys Technologies as a System Software Analyst (I was with Infosys from 2000 to 2006). Infosys was the IT bellwether at that time. It was a huge brand in India at that point and I was fortunate to join them. After my training, I joined the Asia Pacific Business division. I started working for the Customer Service Module (CSM) for DHL Asia Pacific. I worked as a senior developer/Module leader managing 5-6 people team while I had just 3+ years of experience. That gave me a great exposure to team management skills at an early age of my career. In 2003, I moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to work as an onsite coordinator. I worked there for a year and half and then I was relocated to USA in mid 2005 as an Onsite Project Lead. In the Onsite Lead role, I was managing a team of onsite resources (10-15 people) who were involved in requirement gathering, architecture review, system testing and user acceptance testing at client site. I was the point of contact from Infosys team for any issue, escalation and weekly, monthly status reporting for the work streams I was responsible for. I was also involved in career planning, recruitment, and performance appraisal of the resources reporting to me. I had received many appreciations from customers and Infosys management during my tenure at Infosys; the biggest one being the Best of the Best project award for the DW-Knowledge Management project for Gateway Corporation. The project was executed with CMM Level5. It was on waterfall delivery model. We had gathered and prepared all necessary project documents from Infosys and client document library as appropriate for the project. All team members knew the quality processes and standards to be followed. We had maintained a well-documented KT plan for new team members. So when the team size grew to 100+, the onboarding and quality of delivery was seamless. This project had created a lot of reusable artifacts and tools for client and Infosys. It was a great experience to work on this exciting project for this Global data warehouse Implementation.

				While I was working as Infosys Onsite Lead in DHL, USA, I executed an IT Optimization project for DHL IT. This was in the era before the explosion of cloud and virtualized systems. DHL had huge data centers and but they did not know how to optimize and control their IT cost. I lead a team of 5 people and worked with various DHL IT stakeholders to integrate their Configuration Management Database (CMDB) with HP performance and usage monitoring systems to measure the IT infrastructure associated with each project and then rolling it to technology services, business services and into Business Unit level view. We had built an IT charge back module and IT service catalog to enable DHL IT to transform from a cost centric model to profit centric model, aligning with the DHL vision to spin their IT into a demand-supply organization. This was a very successful project and a key project for DHL CIO at that time.

During my stint at Cognizant, I grew up as an Assistant Program Manager to Program Manager to Delivery Manager role.

I was the point of contact for customer for any new project initiation, any delivery challenges or resourcing requirements. As a Cognizant delivery manager I was responsible to make sure projects are delivered on time and on cost, meeting customer satisfaction and internal profitability requirements. My key roles and responsibilities as a Delivery Manager included - 
				<ul>
					<li>Working across multiple work streams like IT Infrastructure and Support service, Master Data Management Service, Data Warehousing service do deliver project for customer</li>
					<li>Strong Agile project experience in leading and guiding team. </li>

			<h3>From 2014 Till Date ..My Experience with Pursuit Solutions </h3>
			<p>
				By 2014, I had a lot of experience, around 16 years by then, in managing and delivering IT services working for various companies like Tata, Infosys and Cognizant. I decided to move to a product company and get a different kind of experience in my career. I was fortunate to join Pursuit solutions in August’2014. They have products in Pharma marketing segment; especially on multichannel marketing and reporting solutions in channel optimization and prescription lift methods. They were looking for a strong program manager to steady their product implementation for GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). When I joined them, this project was already delayed by more than 6 months and some of the key team members had left in the middle of the project. The project was at a tipping point of failure. Pursuit team had many challenges. Pursuit was executing three work steams – a) Data Integration Workstream (WOPR- Pursuit’s cloud based datawarehouse for multichannel marketing) for data acquisation and Integration with GSK data warehouse and campaign response data feeds from various vendors. b) Reporting and Analytics workstream- Implementation of Clearview (Pursuit’s product) to provide reporting and analytics services c) and Integration with Nexxus (A third party product from IMS) for campaign management. All the work streams were running behind schedule. Pursuit had an offshore vendor to help them execute the project. They were billing on Time and Material (T&M) basis, so Pursuit was burning a ton on money on the offshore team but not moving fast to meet committed timeline. Pursuit management were not happy with the offshore supplier, but could not manage or disengage as they did not have much option in the middle of the project. Pursuit was implementing the project on agile way, but very few people were aware of the agile processes. All of these were challenges when I joined the project. It took me 3-4 months to steady the ship. I reviewed the requirements with client, their priorities, and their feedback on the program so far. I talked to my boss and key stakeholders and influencers in the company on their view and requirements for the program. I created a program level delivery plan. Initiated few hiring and got approval to borrow a few resources from other accounts. We interviewed each and every offshore resource again and identified whom we want to keep and who should be released. Got a Scrum Master on contract to help us manage the scrum and train our team. The PMs were communicated on the standard of status reporting, Issue, Risk management and the escalation path when they have any issue. The results started showing in 8-10 weeks. The product was delivered in multiple phases and the final phase was delivered in March’2015. GSK was happy on the turn around, and they signed for extension of this product into few more brands. My key responsibilities in the GSK project included – 
				<ul>
					<li>Manage the different project scrums using JIRA</li>
					<li>Managing the daily scrum calls with internal team and client team</li>
					<li>Creating weekly and biweekly status reports with sprint and project burn down charts for internal and client stakeholders</li>
					<li>Managing Epics, stories and bugs in JIRA</li>
					<li>Managing program level plan, resource movement, hiring for the projects.</li>
				</ul>
